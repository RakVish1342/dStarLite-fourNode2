This project works on comparing the performance between heuristic search like A\* and an incremental search algorithm like D\* Lite.  The algorithm has been implemented for the Pacman environment. Modifications have been made to the environemnt to allow for:

1. Local environment sensing by the robot and retention of information about walls/obstacles over time.
2. D\* Lite algorithm and retention of learned path and priority queue over time.
3. Data and Statistics collection for offline analysis.


## Usage

Go to the ```pacman_incremental_search``` folder and run the following commands:

### A\* Commands
```
python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
```

### D\* Commands
```
python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=dlite,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=dlite,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=dlite,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
```


### Four Node D* Lite Commands
```
python FourNode.py
```

Once the program prompts for the location of the obstacle, please enter (in capital letters) any location except the current robot or goal location. Example, you may input: ```A or B or C or D```. For no obstacle, you may enter ```X```. Sample output for the code is provided in the report.
